a cosmic ocean glows bright green		
with anguish and euphoria		
upon its pristine surface		
endless bodies float waywardly		
on their way through		
the veil that separates		    
modality from form		 
transparent now		
they are fragile and beautiful		
their faults shine in them		
as clumps of large priceless emeralds	
even a slight stirring will break their forms apart		
before they dissolve naturally	
releasing their jewels to the depths	  
from which a bright light shines	
the insane light of eternity	
digesting order with the ever diminishing sap of time

Time is late, fatigue's hooks hang from my eyes      
not quite finished always something more.      
      
a new idea, a new ideal; doubt      
a new distraction; dysphoria      
      
it's terrible this lob sided nature,       
to love life and thereby despise it also.      
      
every thought a dichotomy      
every emotion a discrepancy      
      
Ah, but it's not so bad you see, its never "just" or "just me".      
Poor in spirit, rich in platitudes, face a facade hiding only a broken emptiness.      
      
open mind; dim demeanor      
open mouth; dubious demonstration      
      
How wretched a thing that one can give freely to others what is not self owned.      
Maimed by this depravity, how then to seek without wounding another.      
      
here lies devotion; rotten fruit   
here lies defiance; desolate solitude   
   
Lonely only by definition not decision, nor content.   
Overwhelmed by presence in empty rooms,   
where the voices of potential SCREAM hauntingly.   
Yet I cannot help to ask: Why are the flowers of time always day-lilies?

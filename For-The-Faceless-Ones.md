Do you still tell yourself the story of who you are? Do you even remember it all?  
And how much did you not already lose in your becoming?  

Enter now the trolls and beasts of yonder lands,  
who live in worlds too dark for love and candor.  
They are the most sorrowful ones for they have forgone  
their faces in exchange for recognition of a different kind.  
Compassion should their cruelty reward,  
for devils live in fantasy worlds,  
whilst hearts of flesh bleed and execrate,  
when the world has left them and pulled them asunder.  
  
No dearest other, what is good did not fade;  
it only left for a while to look away,  
as good people are paid to lie,  
and the many too many are taught to  
ignore the sickness that infects our world.  
  
Smile, currency can fix any fate; 
that is, if you're one who can afford the rate.  
Good intentions buried the meek;  
with tax, tithes, loans and insurance deals of the week.  
  
Was it the institutions that sold you your face?  
Or did you sew it yourself?  
Do you wear it proudly, with passion and authentic intent?  
Perhaps you're among the faceless many, wearing masks to hide  
an emptiness that threatens to swallow the world.  
  
There is freedom in faceless-ness,  
but like all else it comes at a cost,  
this time the cost of knowing.  
  
Knowingâ€¦  
Just how arbitrary things are   
How loving, loathing, kind and cruel people can be all at once.  
But most of all how little any of it really matters  

Faces hang as portraits hang; some with meaning, many without.  
Though in time every face bears its subtle lines of doubt.  

What will be the source of consolation in this void?  
A hand to hold? A flower or tree to sketch?  
For some the means to an end, is the justification for a start.  
Here's to those blind enough to see, that,  
life requires a special kind of insanity.

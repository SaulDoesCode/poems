Do you still tell yourself the story of who you are?  
Do you even remember it all?   
And how much did you not lose already in your becoming?   
   
Enter now the trolls and beasts of yonder lands, 
who live in worlds too dark for love and candor.  
They are the most sorrowful ones for they have forgone  
their faces in exchange for recognition of a different kind.  
   
Compassion and communication should their cruelty reward, 
for true devils live in fantasy worlds,   
whilst hearts of flesh bleed and grow to execrate,  
when those homes and peoples they've once loved,  
has left them and pulled them asunder.    
   
No dearest other, what is good did not fade;  
it only left for a while to look away,  
as good people are paid to lie,  
and the many too many are taught to  
ignore the sickness that infects our world.  

Smile, currency can fix any fate; 
that is, if you're one who can afford the rate.  
Good intentions did bury the meek;   
with taxes, tithes, loans and insurance deals of the week.   
   
Tell meâ€¦    
Was it the institutions that sold you your face?   
Or did you sew it yourself with heartache and lace?    
Either way   
Do you wear it with pride, or hide behind it feeling wholly undignified?   
   
Perhaps you're among the faceless many, wearing masks to hide   
an emptiness that threatens to swallow the world.   
Facelessness grants vision above the fray,   
yet comes at the cost of knowing and staying away.    
    
Faces hang as portraits hang; some with meaning, many without.    
Though in time every face bears its subtle lines of doubt.    
    
So what will be our source of consolation in this void?    
A hand to hold? A truth to be told? Perhaps, a flower or tree to sketch?    
For some the means to an end, is the justification for a start.    
Here's to those blind enough to see, that,    
life requires a special kind of insanity.

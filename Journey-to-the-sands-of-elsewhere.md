time died as a single rust colored tear fell into the fine dry sand below  
it doesn't look the way I thought it would, a second fell, it's forever now  
  
I've dreamt of these sweet soft sands  
and how their tender touch would caress my broken soul  
and embrace me the way life's indifference never could  
the answers have had their show and outstayed their welcome  
  
a muddy clump is forming now  
  
I don't feel anymore, that left when my becoming came undone.  
Emotions since are hollow and expression feigned, only, 
so as not to steal from others what life did steal from me,  
or perhaps, what I've stolen from myself  
  
my love for them did not die when I heard them laugh  
it did not die when they listened, nodded and promptly forgot  
nor when they saw my anguish and let me carry their's  
it died when they took my heart and danced with it  
teasing me with false courtesy and rude affection like an ugly whore  
gleefully whispering in my ear in no words at all, that,  
geniality is a luxury the world cannot afford to spare one so contorted as you  
  
a strange slippery heat kisses my skin, it's comforting  
I was vain to think that any of it ever mattered  
a coldness grows over my neck and back, it hurts so bad  
it won't be long now, my face is pressed against the soft sands  
no I can't take it back, I must not take it back  
  
so sore now, the sand is cold and sticky  
I didn't want this, I don't mean it  
I can't move, I can't move  
I can't scream  
...
bitter metal taste, all numb now  
...  
empty now, alone now  
...  
my beautiful wrong sentimental song starts to play...  
...  
play and play...

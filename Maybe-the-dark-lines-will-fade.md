Soot covered face with a solemn smile and    
eyes desperately holding back wincing lines.    
in vain most likely but still…    
Here held is a costly virtue taken for naught.    
Formed as an act of rebellion against a natural state.    
But then again to be, that, is not acting.    
    
No violence will cure ignorance.    
No scolding will heal wounds.    
    
No guilt makes holy.    
No threat makes power.    
    
No piety can cleanse our dirty souls.    
    
Would you lie in the filth of our nature and bear it?    
Would you give your last to the undeserving ones who need it most?    
Can you accept what it is, that it is?    
Even when violated and defaced?    
    
It’s not about righteousness, power or winning.    
    
When last did you thank humanity for not manifesting its worst.    
When broken hearts and crippled souls climb the ladders everyday;    
coming down, returning each night.    
    
Would you build it over?    
Do you know how?    
can?    
    
easy to enjoy as it stands.    
hard to enjoy, knowing what wrath was brought therefore.    
worse still not knowing out.    
where’s out? where’s better?    
where’s healthy and good?; that I can afford.    
    
these painful virtues are needed.

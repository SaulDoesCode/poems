Who among us, still mourns the loss of old gods and daemons?
Who still brings flowers to the graves of dead, and long forgotten truths?

Humanity's pantheon is a blood bath,
in it lies strewn the bodies and limbs of gods
torn asunder by the force of humanity's not knowing;
that is, its not knowing how not to know.

Who now sits upon the thrown of our pantheon?

In the noetic depravity amidst this tragic chaos,
a golem of mud, method, prideful certainty
and holy bones now sits erected upon the thrown.
The teeth of this monster are made of sigil stones:
some representing sight, others truth,
though, there are so many missing,
it's a wonder how this beast bites.

Perhaps, it is our pride, or desperation, alasâ€¦
The new humanity rejoices, worshiping its new god;
despite the sacrifices made to sustain his holiness.

To keep the wretched mass that is our god fed and animate,
a tiny large tribe of special humans work hard purveying new truths;
some reasonably deduced, others forged from necessity or distorted vision.
Still, too many are apported either straight from the ether,
or from the burial grounds of dead gods and worn out truths.

Though in honesty very few,
actually implement and reap the products of their intellect,
and less still the insights of earnest introspection,
and those who do, hardly ever do it for the blessed beast.

If only we knew how not to know;
to accept our not knowing and not be defeated thereby,
to be insane enough to walk naked in the marketplace of values,
to remain open and continue the search for lives worth living.

Without gods, institutions, willful blindness or enthralled craven hearts,
may we seek truth beyond truth and speak it also,
in the place where the function of structure serves life and life alone;
may we lay to rest our notions of grandeur and ultimate insight
for we are naked monkeys dancing alone on the stage of an empty theater.

It is true that we have come thus far,
built wondrous sights and mechanisms to behold,
but know that it is never finished for we live in a forward reality
where war is eternally waged upon all that is inert and unchanging.
So too should one strive to remain malleable and at times fluid,
for holy sanctuary and contemptuous salvation
exists only for those who do not need it.

Where is this safety that humanity once promised itself on behalf of the gods?
Hoh, that terrible ringing of potential,
the screams of squander and the deafening silence of failure,
all rise up like steam from drains in the cities of our minds.
How to overcome when all meaning and structure has fallen apart?

How then to paint,
when the very canvas of life has holes eaten in by a sea of silverfish?
In the end even earthly heroes and gods alike are powerless to defend against
the tyranny of silverfish eating the records of time.

What is left to behold for those yet to come,
but the myths and legends captured in awry old wives' tales?
Perhaps now that some of our all too human dementia is treated,
we would write our lives and our stories in the stars
where silverfish may never tread.
Perhaps someday we will join
the children of stars more ancient than our own
in a heavenly pantheon beyond the shadowy world of forms.

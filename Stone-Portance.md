Once from credence departed, the intemperance of certainty departs also;    
let now the light of life's triumph over inertness gleam forth!  
Even amidst the vast abyss, the voracity of which,  
threatens all that is good in being and time.  
     
Thus I beg...       
Stand triumphant you, upon your ball of shit!  
Though it may have a stank so wretched 
as to rob one of both vision and breath,  
it is this, yes this, that is the glory of the human spirit.  
   
Let that wretched mass be yours and yours truly;    
may you stand with it and stand forthright,
for if you bear it and do not refute it   
and choose willingly to refine it   
then t'will be your anchor in brilliance.   
        
But for it, you would need the strength of three,    
one to hold, a second to roar, and, a third to laugh upon it all.   

May you embrace that wickedness of gaining by letting go,    
knowing full-well that holding too tightly 
only adds to the burden of being   
whilst defiance in the face of loss makes you wealthy in spirit.   
    
Do not fear impermanence like the many too many,    
realize that the waning of one's time is but the waxing of another's.   
Let those yet to come benefit from your being,   
for though you may be forgotten and go unnoticed,   
what you are in every moment echoes forth into eternity,    
so too your words and your actions are forever written in the book of time;     
     
to be experienced by those whom you will never know,    
live for them and do not undermine them by undermining    
the beauty in being and soiling life's sacred recursion.    
    
The value of a stone is either the use of its form, or, the story it holds.    
Stand in your form like the stone, strong and full of life eternal,    
useful to those who would see your value,    
yet vulnerable to the forces of time and change    
only to the extent that your core undermines the integrity of your form;    
however, inevitably form too will wear out beyond its usefulness    
so as not to impede the progress of eternity.    

Though the value of usefulness once had, 
may well outlive that which produced it.
Thus look to the stone that lasts three billion years to tell    
the tale of earth's becoming, become that stone and have    
your verse in the book of time.   
    
One wishes only that it is a verse worth retelling.

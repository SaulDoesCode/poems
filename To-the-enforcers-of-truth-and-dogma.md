How many lies must one buy before the good life is bought?
I don’t want the good life, not by your standards anyway!

Bite me, your ideology means shit in this new dystopia.
There are no more simple virtues in this world,
nothing means anything anymore, and truth?
Well that that can be arranged.

It’s fine to have a perspective knowing that it is a perspective.
But hoh man, what do you do when you’re paddling for dear life in the perspectivistic ocean?
What truth hither comes, when those waves flatten your tiny island’s redoubt over and over?
i dON’T KNOW aNYMORe, pretending doesn’t help either!
But if you really must, then praise the sun like your ancestors,
for unlike most idols it literally grants life and vision.

It’s one thing to do wrong and suffer thereby,
it is another thing to become one’s wrongdoing!
Hence I pity the ostracized and shame-ridden ones,
for they suffer at the hand of common ideals.
Wear your past stupidity like a trophy hat,
because not all can say they’ve overcome theirs.

And to suffer for “deviance”, that which is different?
Madness, if it were not for deviance there would be no humanity!
Are not you despisers of deviance the most impotent ones also?
Hollow subjects of inbred royalty, following your traditions and dogmas,
suffering thereby, I don’t your poison!
Mother entropy wins over all who vainly refuse growth or change.

Ingest! What sounding from beauty comes.
Let no sea wash your eyes of beauties that are sacred to your heart.
For though it may lost on others, it shines in you
and grants you that crucial deviance necessary to step into the unknown
and pluck new fruits from the tree of life for all to enjoy.
Hence when they claim distaste, I claim art, innovation and individuation!

Weather you waste 5 years or 50, grieving or looking for things that don’t exist,
know that your own humanity will eat you up and shit you out,
lest you should seek to transcend your very nature;
it’s never too late to own up to who and what you are,
to strive for that which makes all the suffering seem worthwhile.
Hence it is perhaps better be wrong than bitter, old and right.
The only hard thing is finding a force stronger than motivation
to keep you moving towards infinity and away from the heart of darkness.

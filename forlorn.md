### Forlorn

You’d beat the anchorite of nihilism for hypocrisy?
Carve your sacrosanct virtues upon the foreheads of the forlorn?
And execrate all the same.

There! You may have it all.
Strip the flesh from my bones and enjoy the screams.
Don’t forget to crack the spine
to suck out the marrow, it is the tastiest treat.
Here, I’ll help you pry apart the ribs also,
to expose the fleshen heart ye deem so corrupt.
Does it suffice?

I will not pay for the privilege of suffering,
for it comes freely in abundance to me in good faith.
Unable to properly reciprocate humanity to humanity,
I too am forlorn in the twilight wastelands betwixt
old cultures and a new humanity acculturated
in the after-party following god’s wake.

Condemned to freedom yet unequipped and over-encumbered.
What now dearest other, big other?
Where hence must we venture in the new world?
